A comprehensive record label website for GroupTherapy with integrated admin dashboard, featuring media channels, news pages, and streaming radio functionality built with Next.js and Supabase backend.

Project Overview:
Build a professional, production-ready record label website for GroupTherapy that combines a high-performance Next.js frontend with a Supabase backend and media delivery pipeline. The site must serve fans, press, promoters, and the label team. Key goals: fast load, great mobile UX, rich multimedia presentation (audio + video), reliable live or scheduled radio streaming, and a secure admin dashboard for non-technical content managers to update releases, schedule radio shows, post news, accept demos, and run tours/campaigns.

20+ carousel with lazy-loading covers, automatic & manual advance, keyboard accessibility

Spotify “Listen now” deep-links + track/album preview cards using Spotify Web API / SDK

Events highlights carousel (filter upcoming/past, quick RSVP or “add to calendar”)

Curated playlists section (play inline 30s previews or full stream redirect)

Visual References:
Inspired by major record labels like Interscope Records and Def Jam, known for their multimedia-rich interfaces with integrated music players and dynamic content presentation. Also take cues from modern music platforms and editorial sites:

Bold hero imagery and oversized album art (Interscope)

Clean editorial article layout and artist pages (Def Jam / Pitchfork)

Persistent player UX like BBC/Apple Music (mini-player + full player)

Slick admin UX inspired by modern headless CMS panels (Strapi/Contentful for layout cues)

Technology Requirements:

Next.js framework as specified by user

App Router, Server Components for content-heavy pages, ISR/edge caching for high-read pages

TypeScript for type safety

TailwindCSS for rapid, consistent styling

Shadcn UI / custom components for admin and public components

Framer Motion for micro-interactions

Supabase for backend, authentication, admin functionality, and form submissions

PostgreSQL schema to store releases, artists, playlists, events, radio shows, blog posts, demos, press articles, users, permissions

Supabase Storage for media (images, mp3, video, EPKs) with CDN links

Supabase Realtime for now-playing updates, minor live features, and notifications

Edge functions (optional) for heavy processing tasks (audio transcoding triggers, webhooks)

Spotify API integration for music streaming

Use Spotify Web API to fetch metadata, artist links and to create “Listen on Spotify” flows and embeddable players

Optional: OAuth to allow artists/admins to link Spotify profiles for richer data

Radio streaming functionality with Supabase backend

Stream sources: Shoutcast/Icecast or third-party streaming provider; Next.js player connects to stream URL and shows metadata parsed from the stream or from a Supabase-managed schedule feed

HLS support for modern browsers and mobile reliability; fallback to mp3 stream when necessary

Radio metadata ingestion: either parse ICY metadata from stream or push metadata to a Supabase table via a small ingestion worker / edge function

On-demand archived shows stored in Supabase or an object store and served via HLS or progressive downloads

(Additional recommended technology & integrations — included because you asked for a very full website)

Media Processing:

Use an external worker (serverless function or small Cloud Run job) or Supabase Edge Function to trigger transcoding (audio normalization, HLS packaging, thumbnail generation) when media uploaded to storage

Search & Discovery:

Algolia or Supabase full-text search for releases, blogs, artists, events (fast search experience)

Analytics & Monitoring:

Vercel analytics or Plausible for privacy-friendly analytics; Sentry for error monitoring

CI/CD & Deployment:

Vercel for Next.js deployment (edge functions + CDN), Supabase Cloud for DB/storage

GitHub Actions for tests, linting, and migrations

Payments / Tickets:

Stripe integration for direct ticket sales or donations; Ticketing links to external vendors (Eventbrite) supported

Email & Notifications:

Transactional emails via Postmark/SendGrid for contact/demo confirmations; optional push notifications/one-signal for show reminders

SEO, Social & Metadata:

Next.js Metadata API, Open Graph / Twitter Card generation, sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation, structured data (schema.org) for releases & events

Security & Compliance:

Rate limiting on API endpoints, RLS policies in Supabase, file size/type validation, CSRF protections, HTTPS only, secure cookies, SOC/PCI considerations if taking payments

Testing:

Playwright / Cypress for E2E, Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Lighthouse checks for performance & accessibility
